Got Arch installed and setup.  Even was able to boot into several desktop environments: lxde and xfce aren't bad. And actually gnome has a slick gui.

Anyhow, these three links have been invaluable:

Also this was pretty invaluable after the install

- systemctl enable dhcpcd.service

It helped with getting the dhcp services/daemons configured on

They were great for getting things installed on my computer. Now as for wifi? That'll take digging a little further.
