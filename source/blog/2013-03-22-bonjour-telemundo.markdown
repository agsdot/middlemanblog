Erm…Hello World. But I’ll put my variant and flair on it, not even sure if that’s the correct grammar.  

Well, just ‘ere established this once again another new blog. Previously have had other blogs, including this more recent and kind of a favorite one of mine.  

However, I do see the utility of this tumblr blog.  Got some cool (wait for it, wait for it, buzzword coming soon), social media functions for meeting and socializing with current and new friends.  Also, it’ll be used for the GA SF WDI section (google it) I’ll be in—haha…now thats for a mouthful of an acronym.  

So you reader, expect some postings about tech, but also about the tech yuppie life in SF. Haha.
