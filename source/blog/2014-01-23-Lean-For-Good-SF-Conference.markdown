Wow amazing conference in the Mission district today.  It was at the Victoria Theater from 1 till about 7.  So cool.  Learned a lot about how to apply Lean and Agile methodology to many aspects of life and various business models.

Lol, this deserves more than one post, and more than this concise summary.

I posted a ton of tweets on twitter hashtagging them #leanimpact .  I'll go back through the tweets I posted today, and resummarize them.

Amazing speakers, great examples, so much learned.  Tangible stuff, nothing esoteric.  Great. Inspiring. More than a leanimpact, and amazing impact.
