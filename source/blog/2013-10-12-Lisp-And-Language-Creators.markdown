Ok, so a weekend update. Taulia apprenticeship/internship going well and enjoying it.

As for other code ventures, I've been picking up doing the google lisp-koans.  They are analogous to the Ruby Koans I've done.  Honestly, I just want to learn another syntax/format functional language that helps with programmatic logic development. Kinda neat stuff.  

The only thing I have yet I have yet to find out, I guess the biggest minor blockade (a anachronism there for that statement, eh? but oh well) is to find out how to use the cli/command line interface for troubleshooting lisp assertions for true statements. Its them darn parentheses.  I think I need to have my definitions setf and whatever other language setup before I test or experiment with the assertion value.  Anyhow, I've got clisp and sbcl installed view homebrew on my computer--p.s. will write another entry later about sbcl and its use on the google lisp koans, especially how and why it was named "sb" common lisp.

As for the Language Creators part of this blog entry, this past week I saw a talk by Yukihiro Matsumoto at Scribd.  I'll write another blog entry about this later, but yah, so far I've seen talks by James Gosling of Java fame and this past week a talk by "Matz".  Pretty neat to hear both of them talk.  In several weeks, I'm signed up to attend a talk by Python's Guido van Rossum. Yup, I look forward to giving a review of that too!  That'll be a good blog entry.

Lol, anyhow this blog post just was littered with preludes of upcoming blog entries. I'll write them up soon. Anyhow, here's for the weekly blog post. 

Take care folks!
