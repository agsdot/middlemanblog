Learning lots: coffeescript, json outputs for panics statusboard app, morris js, rspec.
Lots of stuff learned, lots of stuff to review and go over again. But great to be exposed to it all.
Next week, still yet to do D3, backbone and nodejs. I’m excited.
Good career talks, and in the back of my mind, the nagging desire to get started on that side project I’ve always wanted to see done and come to fruition.
Oh yah, need to do a portfolio piece to showcase the works.
Lots of stuff done, and yet to do.
Yup its been a good week, and a good day.
Here’s to May 17th.
