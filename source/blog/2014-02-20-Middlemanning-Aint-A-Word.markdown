My blog I feel has improved over the past couple months.

Put in comments. Upgraded to Twitter Bootstrap 3. Have a new Markdown parser setting.

Haven't yet put in pictures. Lets try.

This first one is sourced fromt the project files

This second one is externally sourced from the web, the ever so useful dynamic placekitten site.
`![Space Kitten](http://placekitten.com/g/200/300)`

Cool stuff!  Going to plan on using images more in future blog posts, especially if I need to document things.
