Ok Mr. Tee-umblr, please go to this new site for updates: agsdot.github.io/thoughts/ Static site blogging, using middlemanapp . Decided to use it instead of Octopress because, well Octopress blogs pretty much all look the same.
My reasons to go off tumblr well, I think I documented it in another blog post, but to reiterate. Y! now owns Tumblr, lets get off it.  Get back on to WP?  No way jose, I’m gonna stick right now with the ruby I learned instead of learning php based systems.  Gotta dig deep into ruby.
So on ruby toolbox, jekyll, middleman, and nanoc were highly listed.  I assumed jekyll would be like octopress in the sense that Octopress is built off it.  I may have been wrong.  Anyhow, I may the choice to go with number 2 on the list, middleman.
And thats where you’ll find my new blog for the time being.  I think the github url looks ok.  Go to that site for the next couple months for my bloggings on code and tech.

P.s. Went to a meetup last night at Academia.edu , and got a lot of help on middleman from a guy there that uses Jekyll for static site blogging.  He said Jekyll is pretty free form and doesn’t have a set look.  Hum….well I’ve come thus far with middleman, but looking at ruby toolbox, Jekyll’s got some huge momentum and might really be good in support forums in the future.
