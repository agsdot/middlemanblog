Today we got to talk to the Los Angeles [General Assembly](http://ga.co) location. They, I believe, are in week 8.  It's neat talking to them.  I really enjoyed being part of the first class at GA in SF, the first West Coast location.  But I also think it would be neat/cool to also have the
resource of learning from a prior class.  We had a good time of Q and A.

Also today we reviewed Javascript at the weekly review.  In particular, 
doing ajax requests sans jQuery but with pure javascript.  It was kind
of neat to review.  Also, it would be good to review this stuff, and
also getting familiar with the
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

Cool week at [Taulia](http://www.taulia.com).  Did a practice coding
assignment.  Got familiar with the grails framework and groovy.  It was
cool practicing the programming logic as well as implementing it in a
different language and framework. Got practice on the backend and front
end.  Grails gsp's, domain, service, controllers and views are
different.
