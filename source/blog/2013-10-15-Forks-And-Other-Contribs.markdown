I was thinking of tagging or summarizing this project keywording it with Github contributions to FOSS project. But really, is it really a github project I'm contributing too?  No, Github is just the dvcs remote. Thats it plain and simple. Github can be it, so can bitbucket, and so I recently learned geekli.st is going to support their own repos too.  Neat stuff.  

Anyhow, back to the topic of what I was going to write about.  Yah!  I did my second pull request to a project and this time it was merged/accepted in!  Earlier this summer I did a pull request for the xiki project, correcting a typo in the Gemfile.  Turns out the project owner already had the typo corrected on his local repo, and he just forgot to push it up to the remote/github.  This time though however, on the GA FB group, I learned about the [bentobox](http://www.bentobox.io/) project.  Its really neat.  It has a ton of great links to resources to learn how to code.

It appears to be some sort of, I'm guessing, Angularjs project with all the content in some content.json . Not really sure yet.  I haven't super dived into the code yet, rather modifying content.json, then starting a local http-server in the directory (this can be done with a python command, forgot what it was, or the excellent npm package http-server, super sweet stuff to get localhost running out of a directory).

Anyhow, I contributed a link to the Groovy.  I figured groovy could use a little love, lol.  I posted a link to the Groovy Goodness blog by Mr. Haki.  I learned about it earlier this summer from Chris at Taulia.  While I have looked and read through several posts in my pursuit of learning groovy, for one of my tickets URL encoding or Base64 encoding, what do you know, I find an excellent explanation for it in the Groovy Goodness blog.  And not only does the [link](http://mrhaki.blogspot.com/search/label/Groovy%3AGoodness) I provide in my pull request link to the Groovy parts, if one goes up to the parent blog domain, one will find Mr. Haki's more general postings, which aren't so general after all.  They don't just apply to the Groovy Language, but more often than not, other projects in the auxiliary Groovy community: grails, gradle, spock, etc.

Good stuff.  Anyhow, the Bentobox project.  An excellent resource for learning how to program, and an excellent project hosted on Github, that is open to pull requests and contributions.  Contribute to Open Source, make a pull request!

P.s. Speaking of forking projects and doing code contribs, I forked the Canvas-LMS projects.  Honestly this is the one project, probably others lol, but this is a major project on Github, that I'd like to get my hands and feet dirty with.  Just forked it.  I want to get it running locally as a rails app, and then search around for typos bugs and content fixes, and start contributing those. Today, I also found out again how to sync my local forked project with the upstream.  Its in a github post how to add an upstream remote.  I may want to detail the steps in a future post.
