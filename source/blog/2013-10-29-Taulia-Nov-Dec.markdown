Woot, woot! Taulia, three month apprenticeship period just completed.  The contract is being extended thru November to December end of year.  

Going to of course be studying very hard on weekends and evenings groovy/grails and java.  But yah, really enjoying it. Super cool.

Also other cool things, like being able to visit potential customer sites on a weekend field trip.  Also, just being able to do social activities like the Taulia singing choir, good non-work activity to have fun and socialize with the coworkers.  Fun/good stuff.
