And a tic tac toe.
Whoa, just finished my first draft of a tic tac toe program.  It accounts for a win, continue game, or stalemating. It also tells you if you are choosing a spot that has already been taken.  
The program seriously needs to be optimized, too many if and else statements.  But hey, its a start.  Code often, code frequently, and optimize and refactor all the way baby!
Oh yah,
