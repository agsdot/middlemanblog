So folks.  Going to wrap up some travel the end of this month.  Went to the Monterey area, and just decided to go to alliteratively another place starting with the same consonant letter, Michigan.

Nah folks, its the same reason I went to Monterey.  Its a great time to see family.  Very much look forward to exploring a different area of America, and frankly just experiencing it.  It'll be cool--understatement--and I'll keep you all posted.

Today, of course packing and preparing for the journeys, but codewise, thinking and reading the docs and websites for Vagrant and Docker. Really want to get to know that stuff well.

Anyhow, here's to the travels!

Laters,
