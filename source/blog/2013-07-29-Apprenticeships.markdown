Today, many of us WDI graduates started our three month apprenticeship.
Some of us got places in the [City](http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/), and others at places down the
[peninsula](http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/).  Some at places that are [python](http://python.org) shops and others, such as
[Taulia](http://www.taulia.com), that are built on top of
[groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/).

Such is the latter case, today I was able to join up with two other WDI
grads, and we started our three month apprenticeship at Taulia.  We got
situated early on in the day, went to a couple meetings. Learned the
names of people, some of the basic systems (email, etc), and went for
lunch at a local food truck (yum :) ).  

However, most of the day can be characterized in what someone responded
to our GA coordinators question of "How was your first day??!" 

`"spent all day configuring my dev environment...still (somewhat) working
on it"`

It was the same for us all it seems.  Lol.  As rvm and rbenv are to ruby
and rails, so will [gvmtool](http://gvmtool.net) be to us in the groovy
shops.  We got to install several versions and types of groovy
applications including [grails](grails.org) and
[gradle](http://www.gradle.org/).

I even got to later ask my mentor a question from that Manning book
"Groovy in Action".  He was able help me with some Java servlet code to
get a jetty server running to serve up web files.  Prety neat :) .

'Twas a great first day.
