Ok Tumblr, its been a good run.  And I’ll still be running with you for a while.  But soon it’ll be Tumblr tata or toodle oo however you spell it.
Sure, the Y acquisitions not to hot on my list.  But was planning in the back of my mind even in march april of eventually migrating the data back to the WP.org instance I had anyway.
Towards the end of teh GA program, I thougth, “Hey, why don’t I use a system like octopress?”  I saw a couple other people at ruby based code schools building static typed blogs around it.
For the past two weeks or so, was considering that as well as others.  Octopress/Jekyll, middleman, or nanoc.  I’m leaning towards middleman, and having a ton of fun learning it.   A static blog, rb files and markdown hosted on github, comments taken care of by disqus.  Interesting stuff.
So what’ll it be Tumblr, talking to you in the personified sense.  Yes, I’ll be blogging here.  Perhaps here and there about the migration of data eventually to another blog system (middleman?).  And also the consolidation of data, wp and tumblr data to the eventual new blog system.  
Dude, I just want “all your bases are belong to me” not some cloud service in the sky somewhere.  And dude, I want it to be ruby based (not php), that is after all what I’ve been practicing the past three months.  Ruby based, well supported and stable.  (I could choose some js type thing such as creationix/wheat but that may be a little premature—of the languages I wanna standardize and dig deep into the rb and the js)
So yes, I’ll post a few tech post here and there on this blog from henceforth.  But mainly articles about the planned migration.  And then they’ll be migrated off.
Tumblr.  Its been nice.
