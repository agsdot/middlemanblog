More to follow later, but sshwitch is a great tool for handling multiple git accounts.  Finding it super useful.  

More to be found here:  
[Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/gems/sshwitch)  
[Github](https://github.com/agush22/sshwitch)  

Update: Wow, super useful.  Just a couple prompts and one can switch ssh keys used for github or bitbucket and then change ones ~/.gitconfig email , and then one can use the same computer to post to different remotes with different corresponding accounts!

Quite neat! And the ruby gem doesn't look that complex.  Some file IO here and there, only 200 lines of code.  

Hum...if I were to try to automate this even further, I would want my .gitconfig files to be swapped as well. But thats another exercise for another day (learning more file manipulation means and tools, whether it be bash shell, ruby or python...)

Awesome tool...awesome...
