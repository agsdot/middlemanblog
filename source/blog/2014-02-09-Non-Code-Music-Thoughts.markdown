title: Non-code Music Thoughts
summary: On music and creativity

Just tapping away at the piano tonight.  Pondering thoughts such as how does one:

- get good at music
- use both the right brain and left brain in creating and maintaining melodies and harmonies spontaneously

I've always wondered why does it seem that many musicians make good coders*

- is it seeing the project from the start and having the foresight to see where things are going
- is it being able to improvise while still maintaining the flow of the piece (be it composition or an application), maintaining coherency.

I suppose these are my creative rambling thoughts on a (rare) rainy Sunday here in California.  Anyhow, I'd like to get good in both, fluently operating in both mediums, and seeing the notes and codes flowing smoothly.

P.s. Had this conversation* with someone last summer.  He played the drums.  He mentioned something along the same lines.  Truly though, it seems I've met more than my fair share, a Berklee School of Music friend, another coworker at work.  I suppose the it leads to the question: does being good at music equat and lead to one being good at coding?

We shall see, anyhow, want to get good at both and have fun in both mediums.
