The ruby project has something called the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com).  They are a great
set of practice exercises to improve ones ruby skills.

While doing things with groovy, I figure that I want my javascript
skills to still stay up to snuff if not improve.  Hence my search for
the a set of javascript koans. 

I found this blog
[post](http://blog.blazingcloud.net/2012/12/28/javascript-koans/) about
javascript koans.  It seems pretty promising.  It even covers libraries
like [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/). 

Well off to working on it and putting it up for a github project to work
on...
