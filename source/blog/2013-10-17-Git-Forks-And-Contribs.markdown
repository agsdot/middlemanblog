Hum...not sure if I mentioned this the other day, but I got a pull request merged in the other day for the Bentobox.io project for the Groovy Goodness link.  Hum, how about contributing a few more good learning links?

I was thinking of Vim (ironic in that yesterday, I wrote that whole article/post on emacs...haha). The Bentobox Vim section was looking a little lonely with just a link to [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/). So, I added in the upstream remote, updated my local repo, and decided to contribute another link: [The Interactive Vim Tutorial](www.openvim.com/tutorial.html).

There are a couple git workflow things I wonder about though.  I suppose these would more inherent to the github/bitbucket methodology of forking, vs [Gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/) (I still have yet to grasp this git workflow paradigm and mechanism -- I heard more about it at the Wikimedia meetup I went to last month).  Anyhow, if one updates their local remote to the upstream, does a pull request, it succeeds and is merged, wonderful.  But what about the scenario where the pull request is rejected?  What is supposed to happen to the forkers local repo? Does/should that recent commit be removed? Or is there something in the whole github/bitbucket pull request paradigm to account for this?

Well, I contributed a fairly innocuous/solid/sound pull request and am pretty sure it will be merged.  But there will come cases in the future, where I'll want to be involved with a project continually (hence doing the whole sync to upstream remote), but some pull requests will be successfully merged and some will be denied?  I guess I'll learn then what happens to those commits that were rejected, both on my local computer repository, as well as the github/bitbucket style repository remote.

Anyhow, those are just merely some of my git learning ramblings.
