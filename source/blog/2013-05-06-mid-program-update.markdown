Ok, so just finished week 6 of 12, and about to start week 7.
This next week we’re going to be starting work on a group project. It’ll be due on a week from Monday.
A quick summary of things to come for the week: working in a team of four, our idea is to make a bookmark type service for quotes one finds on the web, going to learn alot about javascript to do this, going to also learn more about how to collaboratively work with people on tech/coding projects.
It’ll be interesting learning and doing more of git collaborative work, such as branching and merging.  Don’t know if it’ll get to any rebasing.  But eager to see how git works in a collaborative setting.

JL signing out.
