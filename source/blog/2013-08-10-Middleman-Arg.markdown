Ok, so I finally find a good example middleman app with source code on
github that has the exact things I need: an indicator/link for next page
and previous page.

I don't want to have a blog with a continuous scroll (or even dynamic
ajax pagination right now).  Honestly I want the main page to show 10-15
posts, then have subsequent pages that display show the "next" or
"previous" 10-15 pots.

I finaly have a good source code project. I came across this blog entry
by [Joey
Aghion](http://joey.aghion.com/building-a-blog-with-middleman-and-github-pages/) and his [source code](https://github.com/joeyAghion/joey.aghion.com/commits/master).  He's got the things implemented that I want to put in. 

Great!  However, I'll need to lookup middleman methods and try different
things.  dbtlr and aghion, two middleman blogs I am trying to model, set
up their blogs in slightly different ways.

Its a good thing knowing that I've got my good ol' markdown files, which
are used pretty much the same across both projects.  If need be, I could
mirror one project or another more or less closely and plunk in them
markdown files.

Even though the title of this post "Middleman Arg" kind of started
feeling like a gripe post, I'm really realizing what a blessing this
ruby application is.  Middleman allows me to continue to keep my hands
and feet dirty (in a good way) with ruby code, making sure that I stay
on top of the stuff and that I don't forget my ruby.  Gives me practice,
not letting it get rusty.  And that my friends, is a blessing in and of
itself.
