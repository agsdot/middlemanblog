Arg, trying to fix the DNS issue.  Trying to work the dns issue for my S3 bucket.

In the browser, I can already goto 

somedomain.com

but not

www.somedomain.com  

Why, why, why Route 53 AWS domain services do you so treat me.  I've read through the AWS guidelines/tutorials on this one, and I've googled for searches.  

Never, have I called a company on this, normally googling stuff.  Maybe I'll contact other people that have done AWS especially domain aliasing. Then at last resort call them folks in WA state.
