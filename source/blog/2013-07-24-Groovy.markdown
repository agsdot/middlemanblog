To learn groovy I am using [Groovy in Action, Second Edition](http://www.manning.com/koenig2/).

To learn grails, I am going to following this tutorial,
[Getting Started with Grails, Second Edition](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/grails-getting-started)

I bought the ebook for the Groovy in Action, 2nd edition.  Ebook + print
book to follow later.

Interesting language so far.  Github commits to follow later :smile:
