Ok folks, so here's the main goal.  Consolidate the blog entries off of tumblr and wordpress and onto middleman.

Several reasons:

1) Tumblr, well all your bases are belong to me.  Yahoo, no, yahoo no.

2) Wordpress, php, why learn a language that I have no need of now?  I've been learning ruby for the last three months.  I want to dig deep into rb and js, not php.  Maybe later but not now.

3) Static blogs are secure.  No database insecurities, issues with caching.  Simpler site, simpler technology, simpler to scale.  Less points of attack.

4) Experiment with a rb static blog (obviously choice of middlemanapp is present now), but also experiment with commenting systems such as disqus (most likely candidate) or livefyre.

5) Middleman is a great system to learn templating languages and file types used often in the ruby community: markdown/md, haml, slim, erb.  Practice them when I use rails, and practice them when I don't. Practice them on a daily basis when I blog.

P.s. Added benefit, of learning how the importers exporters are used on tumblr and wordpress, migrating to a static based system, and this systems more portable.  Can use on S3 buckets, dropbox, and other places for hosting of html static files and can use markdown.
