summary: Markdown and Groovy
tags: syntax, programming

Markdown is a neat html replacement language to learn yet so far.  I
remember back in the day, textpattern (a CMS like Wordpress but more
hardcore) invented textile for their textpattern (fyi, history note,
Joyent the maker of Textpattern later rolled out this tiny javascript
project called Node).

Markedown so far I've implemented mainly two features.  Code escapes and
quick URL links.  

for Code.  Include a backtick ` .
for URLS. Include a square bracket then a regular parentheses.


* ``wwww.code.com`` code can be escaped with a backtick, the character
below the tilde next to the 1 key.
* `[code website](http://www.code.com)` is how you would create the
following URL but obviously shorthanded `<a
href="http://www.code.com">code website</a>`

Its also interesting reading online resources, pdfs, and books about
Groovy.  Interesting dynamic language borrowing strengths from python
and ruby, while inheriting advangtages from Java's JVM.
