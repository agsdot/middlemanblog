Its quite refreshing to find the correct answer on the internet from
something like [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

However, it is nice to read stuff straight from the source.  Reading
stuff from the
[ruby-doc.org](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html) documentation for both IO and [Arrays](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html).  It
has been a nice review day.
