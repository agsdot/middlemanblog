Went to a meetup tonight at Pivotal Labs. Its quite interesting, each
time I goto a "pair programming" meetup, they each have their own flair.

Protonight at OpenTable: very structured
Academia.edu: very freeform
Pivotal: round table discussion of issues

Pro's and con's to each.  

Tonight though, as a peripheral benefit to having a db question I had
addressed, I got to meet some friends from other bootcamps. (One from
Dev and one from App).

One of them, I got to talking about MacVim.  For the longest of times, I
was wondering what was the best way to comment out things.  

He mentioned using Visual Blocks to have the cursor do actions in more
than one spot.  I had seen this once done before by
[Erik](http://www.github.com/sferik), but never really knew how to do
it.

Ctrl-v then highlight the text you want to act on.  Then do the
keybinding for i or a, to do before or after, then enter a comment text
such as `//` or `#` .

Interesting stuff.  And you know what, thats not such a bad way to do
highlighting.  Manual but intuitive.  

The guy from Dev Bootcamp also shoed me the basics of vimrc files.
Mighty cool stuff man.
