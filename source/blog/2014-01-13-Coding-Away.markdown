Today, I read the rubydocs and did some practices based on links from the ruby-docs website.  Good stuff. Read good stuff.  Also practicing executing the bash commands.  The CLI command line interface is good.  Good stuff.  Messing around in the CLI and with a simple text file with Vim.

Focused on doing stuff with file manipulation.  I tell you here's the plan.  Get good with file IO then get good with the network IO.  Thats how you roll it to get good with server administration.

Yeah!
