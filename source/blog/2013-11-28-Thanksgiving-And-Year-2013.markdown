I wrote an email to my three teachers/instructors from GA several days ago.  It was a letter of thanksgiving for how they have so helped me this year.

I liked receiving the feedback and replies from them.  It was so awesome to be able to say Thank you but also to hear from them back as to what teaching means and how much they enjoy teaching and coding.

In short: thanks for the email, it means a lot to us teachers; life gets better and better doing the whole freelance and contract and coding work in the SF Bay Area; it was a joy to teach, having the GA students was a great experience, and continue to pursue making stuff with code, and the whole joy of coding and programming.

Yah, its been grand, the joy of coding and creating things with code.  Seeing how systems work together.

The sky truly seems to be the limit here in SF.  Looking at last year in LA and the opportunities then vs now, I shall draw the comparison:

- upward growth, job mobility, always new things to learn
- much more fields to work and grow in: software engineering, devops, and qa
- a much more plentiful culture of meetups and self learning
  - Also, a much better transportation system, so getting to meetups is much easier.

Thankful,
