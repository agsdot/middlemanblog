The past week or so has been really nice.  Got to say my individual farewells to many people at Taulia.  Really good conversations with several people.  Its been nice to have these past two weeks of my contract to say goodbye.

Today, I wrote several emails to different people and groups of individuals.  Its nice to hear all the kind words people have to say back.

Taulia has been a wonderful environment, a great place to apprentice and contract at.  Great people, great culture.

Viva la compania de Taulia!
