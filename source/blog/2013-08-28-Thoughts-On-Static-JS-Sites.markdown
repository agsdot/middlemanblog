Wow some of these javascript static sites are quite amazing.  Lots of stuff.  Docpad has literally a dozen templates, with one even called a kitchen sink.  Yah, I know.  

I suppose the only thing about these, is I don't want their to appear too much magic in that which it does for you.  Also, docpads got some funny license, tos, eula type of stuff even though the project is MIT licensed.

Wintersmith is also an interesting looking project.  Little simpler looking, less templates (also less overwhelming upon first impression), but Docpad looks like its got momentum in terms of commits.

We shall see.  In the meantime, I'm here on me's middlemanapp, and shall continue to blog away.
