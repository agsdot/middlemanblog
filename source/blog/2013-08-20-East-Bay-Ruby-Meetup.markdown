The [East Bay Ruby
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/EBRuby/events/125050982/) today was pretty awesome.  In short:
presentation on Vagrant by Mitchell Hashimoto, and guest visit by Gregg
Pollack of Code School fame.

Vagrant is a great virtualization / deployment / setup / devOps tool
which you can configure with shell/ruby/puppet/chef.  I
learned a lot listening to the presentation.  Seems like a very bright
future for the project.  Lots of companies use it, Github, Mozilla, BBC
News, Yammer, Expedia, Disqus and the New York Times to name a few.
[Mitchell Hashimoto's](http://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant) definitely made a great product.

Also neat to see Gregg Pollack peruse and walk into the room.  He's
doing a presentation later this week at the San Francisco Ruby on
Thursday on good development practices.  So neat to see him in the room.
Yes, currently he leads the [codeschool](http://www.codeschool.com) online learning resources, but
honestly I first remember the videos that came back way back when
comparing Ruby on Rails [vs the
World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQbuyKUaKFo). Yes, I met Mr. Ruby on
Rails...."Hi, I'm Ruby"... Lol....

Got to shake both Mitchell's and Gregg's hand.  Pretty neat for one day.
Meet both people in East Bay Ruby, and last time 2 month's ago, listened
to [Yehuda's](http://yehudakatz.com) talk on Ember.  Pretty darn awesome.  I'm liking this East Bay Ruby Meetup, John and Rich lead a good meetup group.  To be commended. Great speakers, but also a nice homey feel to the group too--something not always found in Meetup groups.
