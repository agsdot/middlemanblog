Ok so *Travels with Charlie* that was Steinbecks thing, sorry folks, never read the book, and never rode a pickup truck that old.  The title of this 'ere post will be Travels with Learning.

This month, took the opportunity to travel to Monterey and Michigan.  Take the op to spend time with family and folks along the way.  Super awesome to spend time to stand back sit back and reflect.

Anyhow, in addition to the travel, reaching out to different friends and contacts, making connections with peoples at meetups, and reaching out to co's and agencies.

Also, spending a fair amount of time doing what I call "micro-travels" (take that Kiva! ha!), yah, I jumped on the *micro* bandwagon.  Frequently, I walk to different Starbucks and Peets and different libraries.  Then I plunk down myself, take out my notepad, write and scratch away notes, and work on my laptop.

Its how I went through much of the Vagrant docs, Ruby docs, and just tapped away at some projects.    Traveling and staying learning, changing the scenery, freshening it up, and keeping learnin' .  Here's to traveling, locally and globally.  Less than 1 mile or more than 1 mile.  Take your pick America!  Take your pick world!

Enjoy!
