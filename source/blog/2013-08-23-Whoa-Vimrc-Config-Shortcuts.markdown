Originally I was going to do a post on "On the Significance of SSH Keys with Git"(that'll be for another day), but then I noticed that my vim configuration didn't have the line numbering setup--typing from a newly setup computer.

Ah crud, do I want to setup [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) or copy someone else's .vimrc file, and not really understand whats happening with the vimrc or the plugins? Nah...no I don't.  I want an easy quick plug and play fix. Not that for the solution I found, I totally understand the whole vim plugin system of pathogen/vundle, but heck I know how to use these plugins now!  Progress!

I present the solution.  [Brian Leroux's Quick Vim](https://github.com/brianleroux/quick-vim) project.  Super awesome.  Do it, just do it!  I posted my [fork](https://github.com/agsdot/quick-vim) of the project here.  Pretty self explanatory*, just do it! Come on...do it!!!

P.s. It really doesn't matter what directory you clone the project from, just remember where you did it. You know, the first lines of the instruction `git clone git://github.com/brianleroux/quick-vim.git` .  Thats the only lines of the project I wondered* about. Easy answer!

P.s.s. Yah, yah, yah, I know I've been just prodding do it do it.  But when you do it, clone Brian's github not mine.  Mines got customizations for ruby syntax, groovy syntax, solarized light, and line numbering. Customize it to your liking :)

P.s.s.s. Yes, one day, I will understand how to use Pathogen and Vundle.  Baby steps, then walking, then running.
