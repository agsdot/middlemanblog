I want to make something quick, where I can sort an html table by column and add some bling blang front end effects to the table: sort, mouse over hints, navigate table.  Just want to try out some of this stuff.

Anyhow, was thinking about scaffolding and doing a real quick rails projects for the db on this.  Then was thinking about it, as I was examining the front end frameworks: jquery, sorting columns, etc. Then I recalled the [sheetsee](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js) project which relies on [tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/) and google docs. I may try to do something with tabletop.js to quickly get some "backend" to these tables.  We shall see.

P.s. I really gotta get back to the middleman code for doing a blog plus a next page.  I'll figure it out.  This weekend, I'll do some scaffolding for initializing a plain jane middleman-blog, and see how they code a next page...that and or compare it to someone else's middleman blog.
