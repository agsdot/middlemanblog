Wow, well its been 12 weeks. Lol, for the past “13th” week so to speak, I’ve relaxed and taken a bit of a step back from coding—but I continued to push to github.  Just came back from a roadtrip to Oregon at the end of the week.
For my last week at GA WDI, I worked on a Learning Management system idea I’ve had in mind for a while.  Its an app where students and teachers can upload documents and provide comment feedback on it.
The only thing is, there were a lot of databases to account for in this project.  Users, Courses, Assignments, Papers, and Comments.  Also a couple join tables as well.  It was interesting and a hard task.  I still have to polish off several things for the project, but I’m glad that I did it.
I’m glad that I did this class.  I feel like it has opened up a world of possibilities.  Just to be able to explore rubygems.org and github and try out various ppls project code and make mashups with them, its wonderful.
Now for the next couple weeks, going to continue to push code to github.  Polish off code from the projects. And look for internships/apprenticeships/jobs.
