The Taulia contract will be over soon.  It was not extended.  Hum...what am I thinking right now?  Hum...several emotions, but primarily gratitude.  It was a great place to apprentice and contract at.

I learned a lot of things: Scrum methodology with Sprints; got to experience a really great company culture where the PM's, Dev's, and QA's complement one another; got to experience a midsize startup; worked at a company with an invigorating culture and growing product; improved coding capabilities, with Java OO restricted programming, and practiced using Java and Groovy based tools (e.g. Tomcat, Gradle, IntelliJ ); got to indirectly learn about devops; pondered thoughts on scalability for both a product and building a team.

Twas and has been grand.  I'll have several more weeks here at Taulia.  Really cool experience.
