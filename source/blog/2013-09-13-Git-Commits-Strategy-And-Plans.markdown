Ok, as I sat here today (Ok, stood and sat, buts thats another matter), I thought about a good strategy to continually commit code. Yes, I like and want to continue to commit code each day.  But meaningful code. Eh, meaningful code?  Does that mean more than a ruby or javascript koan, more than a static blog page post and a minor edit?  Yes, I mean more than something like that. But how often towards the middle or end of the day, do I find myself thinking, what kind of code will I work on or commit today. Then I'll find some mundane backburner project to work on (i.e. koan or a blog post in markdown).

Not good enough, and no I don't think I would say I'm putting the bar too high at that.  Sure an occasional koan or blog post fine. But deliberately strategizing at making meaningful git post.  Don't want to burn out on creativety, but also don't want to do meaningless or tidbit code commits either.

So I've been thinking about it.  What should guide my code commits?  What kind of projects and tasks?  Well here goes a draft list of ideas:

-static blogging (ruby and javascript based--i.e. middleman and docpad or wintersmith)  
-graphic library based - (most likely d3 and or d3 javascript based), code and lines of logic are nice fine and dandy, but there is beauty to be found in art and images and creating a canvas of colors. Plus it just taxes the brains creative side besides the mathematical/scientific number crunching part. It alleviates and provides a break and a creative outlet. Enough said.  
-javascript library and land based - small projects and tasks to make things with Express.js and MVC frameworks (backbone, angular and ember). Learning and doing stuff with the [MEAN](http://www.mean.io) stack (the future seems to be going this way, Mongo Express Angular and Node).  Shoot, even at a Grails shop, things are going the way of using Mongo for some database stuff. Gotta learn this stuff and stay ahead of the curve.   

P.s. Other extraneous, miscellaneous (and whatever alliteratively rhymes with those two words cool sounding word) goals, gaming and mobile libraries.  Lua for Corona and Java for Libgdx for mobile gaming.  Shoot making mobile or desktop apps would be super awesome. Node-webkit, tidesdk/tidekit, (js based ones), or griffon (groovy/java) just to name a few, but those are extraneous goals. The mobile and desktop applications.  Don't want to stretch too thin and then accomplish too little.  The goals, and I would say them again are in the first three.  Web based, javascript, frontend based things. Two being expressly technology, javascript and ruby focused, and one more on the art/creative side.  

P.s.s. Other ideas in the future to guide code commits, shoot, look at the github projects I star/favorite. Look how they do stuff, try to reverse engineer it, and make stuff to my liking for my own projects.

As Picard would say (yes, somewhat of a Star Trek person), "Make it so."
