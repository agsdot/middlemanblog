Whoa, just found a great website for building sites with static site building tools. Some in ruby, python, js and php.

I present: [ModernStatic](http://modernstatic.com/)  

I'm particularly inspired by the js / node.js projects. 
[DocPad](github.com/bevry/docpad) looks particularly interesting

Enjoy!

P.s. Who knows, may one day try to perfect them javascript and practice them skills using a static js node built site?  [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), will the ride just be only a couple months short?  Wink wink....we'll see :)
