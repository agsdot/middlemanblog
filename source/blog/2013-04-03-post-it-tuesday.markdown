Yes, a good goal would be to blog post at least three times during the M-F week.  I’ll see if I can do it.  

Snippets are good.  I’ll do the microblog post updates here.  

Two highlights: created github website and visited Twitter HQ.  

agsdot.github.com is the URL , learned how to obviously update site with git. Think its using cname records to map it.  

Twitter.  Not only have I gotten to go to 1355 Market St (last week, Project Runway SF), but got to SF 9th floor to listen to Developer talk.  Great experience  

Last pp more than 140 char? Who cares.  This is one ‘ere blog that don’t be matterin about style syntax diction or letter length.  

Long live Tumblr, and long live Twitter Card on Mobile!!!
