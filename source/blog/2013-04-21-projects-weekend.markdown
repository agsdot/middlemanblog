We’ve been doing a lot of working on our first quarter (I dunno if its called a quarter, or half, or whatever, but “first quarter project” sounds cool).  Thats whats been happening mainly from Tues-Fri this week.  
Today Saturday has been a long day for several reasons. However, I was able to go to Peets and chop and hack away and get some cool things done with Google Maps.  Later on this evening, lol as of 11:49pm, after github commit and push, I was able to get some nifty features put into the input bar as well.  We’ll wait for Monday to see it implemented.
A lot of the CSS has been done.  However, I heard that to put in Devise Authentication, its best to have that be the first controller/model put in (one of them is “invisible” for Devise (just github it)).  Anyhow, it would be good to do a clean refresh install of the project I’ve been working on.  As of the past few days, I was going off a modified test project file originally that I used on Tues/Wed to test the geocoder gem.
Done: for most part all CSS, except one page.
Todo tomorrow: clean slate do another rails new **projectname**
   gems to implement —> devise, geocoder , and then I need to reimplement rails generate mailer, dadahdah….
