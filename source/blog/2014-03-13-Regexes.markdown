Man, some powerful stuff.

Regular expressions.  Used in combination with themself and other commandline tools like sed, man super sweet with what it can do.

Mighty cryptic though getting it down and practicing it.

Thats why I'm glad there's this here site for testing them out. Behold, [Rubular](http://rubular.com/).  Good stuff indeed.
