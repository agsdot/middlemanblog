Wow, can't believe I'm probably about 2/3rds the way through my apprenticeship. I haven't really blogged that much about it.  Last several weeks though, its been real satisfying to push code to the production base.  Code here and there assigned from the Scrumm meetups.  Real satisfying when I get the issue resolved and write smoke tests.  Grails is a neat platform. Lol, sometime when thinking about Groovy and Ruby, I remember more groovy syntax.  Gradle also is a neat tool. Real lightweight means to produce an app.

With regards to code, I've been trying as of recent to work on D3 javascript projects.  Work a little here and there on javascript.  Gotta be beneficial, working on all 'em callbacks and all.

With regards to other languages, recently bought a book I saw at Barnes & Nobles on Ebay, Land of Lisp.  Real fascinating book when I stopped to read it at the bookstore. Functional languages.  Functional programming, things like Scala indirectly derived and inspired by them.  There's also functional js programming as well.  Reading the book, it states that modern languages are basically derived from two groups: Lisp from MIT and Fortran/Algol , C being a derivative of the latter, with Java Python and Ruby streaming down from the C branch.  Interesting stuff.  Lisp however, one can learn some nifty program and design principals.  I think it might be a fun read.

Just got the book in the mail yesterday.
