Ok folks, here's to the Last Day in the East Coast with their whole Eastern Standard Time.  Oh for my git commits to come from UTC -5 hours vs 8 hours.  Here's to leaving the Michigan, and a farewell not to arms (never read the book, lo siento) but rather Michigan(singular not plural).

Its been good folks.  Awesome to spend time with my sister attending the University of Michigan.  Super awesome time. Got to hangout and do some of the common everyday stuff (aka mundane). But honestly, its that stuff that I really enjoyed.  I didn't come here to see museums or an auto show. Its for the people, and to see and check up on my sister.  Yup, my sis! To meetup with her before graduation, to see her and her friends.  And that I succeeded and accomplished.

Yah, so here I sit in the DTW airport, typing away on their wifi in my Vim instance.  Cool stuff.  Yesterday, I got to sit at Zingerman's and buy and eat an expensive pastrami sandwich...AND....sit there for three more hours and tap away on some code, feasting on their wifi.

Actually, it was really productive.  Great restaurant, great vibe and atmosphere inside.  The foods a little pricey, but great vibe.  I was able to do a couple things with my middleman app blog you see here (hosted on github and middleman as of Jan 2014).  I updated the Gemfile to use all the current Middleman gems.  I switched from Bootstrap 2 to Bootstrap 3.  That in addition to finally putting in some Disqus comments.  I'd say its been a pretty productive coding day.  Hoo-rah!!!!

Its been good folks. Spending time here in Michigan.  I'll miss you Michigan. It's been good.  Next time, I shall no longer see your snows, and in May I shall see your beauty--flora and fauna galore.
