Twas a good day in Michigan.  A nice slow Sunday

-  Visited my sisters church in Michigan.  Awesome to spend time their and get to meet her friends.
-  Went to Best Buys, picked up a cell phone.  Prepaid.  Not bad.  Hum...I might consider doing that in the future.  An android phone. As long as its a popular enough piece of hardware that I can put a cyanogen distro of some other android rom on it.
- Went back and tapped away at Docker.  Fascinating system.  AUFS, unifying file systems.  Making cascading images.  Fasnating stuff.  Workflows a little more involved than Vagrant (there are more cmd options), fascinating nonetheless.
- Went to the business school, did a little bit more coding/learning about Docker.  Also trying to learn more about selling on Ebay.
- My sister and I had dinner in the evening, and I made meatloaf.  Haven't done that in the long time.  It was pretty good.
