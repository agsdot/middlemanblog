Today, flew to Denver then to Detroit.  Then trucked on over to Ann Arbor to meetup with my sister at Michigan.

Quite an adventure.  A good midwestern state.  Hum...known and renowned for JFK's speech which helped start the Peace Corp and that whole generation.  Some nobel laureates.  Hum... I think it may have been one of the four universities that helped spark the internet.  Not sure about the last one.  Regardless though spectacular U in the midwest.

Got to visit State street. The Law School building. Ross School of Business.  Ate at an eatery Maize and Blue Delicatessen.

Awesome to spend time together with my sister.  Looking forward to the next couple days.

P.s Snow snow and more snow. Man, and frozen ice atop the pea gravel of some tree planters on the side of the street.  Now thats cold.  Seemed surreal, almost like an icerink surrounding some maple or elm trees lining the college towns roads.
