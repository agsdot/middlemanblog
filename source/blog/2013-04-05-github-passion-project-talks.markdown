Hey All,
Just had a great day.  Got to visit Github HQ in the SOMA district of SF, 3rd and Brannan.     
Got to listen to a talk by Mozilla Firefox dev Heather Arthur.  See [tweet](https://twitter.com/harthvader/status/319970917361016833) for more info.  Also tomorrow I’ll post more stuff (or maybe later this weekend).  

Enjoy these pictures :)
