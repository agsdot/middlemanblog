Today, had some fun at Starbucks.  Walked a couple miles to the Starbucks in the next town over.  Great to walk and then do some reading.

I experimented with software and read articles regarding Vagrant, Docker, and Dokku -- a docker application that can with several lines of code emultate a heroku instance.  Thats pretty cool I must say.  I'd like to do that soon some day.

First things first, gotta know and do Vagrant and Docker first.  Vagrants written/based on Ruby and Docker is primarily written in Go, but uses Vagrant for some OS use cases (Docker can't run on Mac OS X bsd stuff, therefore one needs to setup a linux instance to with Vagrant..simple enough)

Therefore, I updated my Vagrant instance/installation.  Then proceeded to tap away Vagrant commands, as well as trying the example Docker installation that was linked from Github.

Here you go folks.  Some useful links for today, in the quest to become better at server administration also known as development operations also known as the devops person deploying stuff to the cloud (mostly aws, but other virtualized hosted instances).

Enjoy Folks,

JL
