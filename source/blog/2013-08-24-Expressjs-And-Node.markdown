Woot Woot!!! I found a decent small/midsize [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) [project](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) to learn from on Github.  Once again thanks to the Brian Leroux of Nitobi/[Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/)/Adobe/JS fame, I've found a nice project to emulate.

Yes, the ever so appropriately named [wtfjs](http://github.com/brianleroux/wtfjs) project--check out the code and clone it from here. Yah....maybe not so appropriately named. Anyhow, fascinating website [though](http://wtfjs.com/)--Go ahead, check it out!  You'll learn a thing or two about JS, and the warts to avoid (ah, I need to post a picture up sometime comparing the booklength of this [book](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) compared to this [book](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-Activate-Guides/dp/0596805527)--yah, some 200 pages of good stuff, to 1100 pages of all the stuff...thought of the day, how much bad stuff is there, or warts to avoid? ...well it gives you a lot of stuff to appreciate when you find the nice stuff :p

Yes, its a nice little/medium size blog project, where once node/npm/and expressjs are installed, you can clone the project, get into it, do an npm install, act upon that there package.json file, and then do the following command based on the file server.js : `node server` (yah, if it was called app.js you would put in "node app" or whatever.js you would put "node whatever"). Yup, gotta learn that node and express js server side js workflow.

Hip hip hooray!!! More code to clone, rip, and learn from. Node and Express away!!! Hip Hip Hooray!!!
