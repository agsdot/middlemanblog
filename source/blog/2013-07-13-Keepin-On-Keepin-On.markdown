Folks, well things been not too bad.  Trying to do my continual commit to github.  I read somewhere something recently (past 3 months on lifehacker) something about "just don't quit" with regards to something like running.  How do you stay in shape, how do you get in the performance peak to run marathons, abide by one motto: don't quit.  It was honestly very inspiring trite as that might sound.  Then there's this other blogger, she's doing some fitness iOS and rails apps, doing of course the tech thing, but also mentioning about fitness too.  If you don't quit you win.  Intriguing thoughts.  Just don't quit.  Things to live by? Guiding mottos and dictums?  Hum...perhaps so, and perhaps also good guiding principals.  I'll just keep it at that.

Well anyhow, I been doing this whole commit to github regularly keeping along those lines.  Let persistance be my weapon, let it be used to my faculty and to press to my advantage.  Even if its a small commit, I'll continue to learn. Stagnation doesn't occur when you keep pressing on, even if its a small ruby practice exercise, or a practice on editing a markdown file.  Heck, you learn the syntax of markdown at the very least.  So yah, thats been my application of the don't quit paradigm mentioned in the preceding paragraph. (Now to just apply it to other things, as another lifehacker article went, pair up a good habit you've got or something you really enjoy doing with what you aspire to do--I'd say that would be to exercise a bit more. Its just that I find exercise to be most fulfilling when I've got a destination in mind. Walking or biking two miles to get to that coffee shop to code away on the computer, anyhow thats for another post).

So as to what I'm truckin' on, as I so eloquently spoke of.  Yup, really piping out my West Coast verbiage.  (FYI, truckin' on is not in no way West Coast verbiage, haha).  Technology-wise, I've been trying to pick up Express.js, a node thin framework similar to Sinatra/rb and Flask/py.  Its not bad.  Learn little principals here and there, such as the following

**There are two types of parametric GET requests in Express.js - req.params and req.query.
The req.params object contains request parameters right in the URL. It uses the clean URL scheme. Eg: http://example.com/product/1274.
The req.query object contains request parameters in the GET query. It uses the conventional GET request scheme. Eg: http://example.com?product=1274.**

Good to know.  The params hash in ruby, that I think was one of the biggest breakthroughs of WDI.  You can pass more data through gets and post and through the URL with the GETS.  Interesting stuff, and now just learning a bit more from Express.js that there are req params and req query.  Some look cleaner, and some have those question marks.  Just don't quit.  You learn from the little codings here and there, and the tutorials along the way.

Express looks really awesome.  Dude, to pick up Express and Sockets, and then move onto Sailsjs, thats to truly pick up an MVC framework in Node.  Cool stuff.

Anyhow, other truckin' on's would include reviewing AJAX.  I'd like to review that tech a bit.  Review that a bit before digging into Backbone/Ember.  And of course, keep up my ruby.  Practice the rails, and of course by virtue of this 'ere blog practicing my middleman static framework skills.

Well anyhow, its been a long post.  Thanks for following and reading.

P.s. Disqus comments are going into hiding once again/comment out mode.  I need to try to reimpliment those.  Gonna follow dbtlr's github commit history to see how they were implemented. That and/or learn how to integrate disqus stuff from scratch with or without a gem.
