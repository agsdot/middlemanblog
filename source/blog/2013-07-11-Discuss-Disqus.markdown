Well folks, as you well see below, circa July 11.  Commenting has kinda not been, kinda has been attempted.  Middleman-disqus gem.  Put in the configs both in the config.rb file and also the disqus website.  Humph....not working yet so far.  Oh well.

Will fix it up soon, and look into it more.  Just wanted to post update.
