Ok so what are my thoughts about Archlinux on a Mac?

Hum...overall positive, but a mixed bag.  

The window managers and DE's such as LXDE, XFCE, and Gnome run just fine. Xorg and startx load up super fast.  I'm really pleased with that.

Once I got wifi working, it works pretty reliably.  I like that too.

Ok...whats the concession?

The laptop power mode.  On this 'ere Macbook 9,2 purchased in 2013, a 2012 macbook 13 inch model, man, archlinux on it just makes the bottom of it just emanate heat.  Not cool Arch.  Sure, its not optimized like the mach bsd darwin osx is, but man, I gotta find a way to download those pkgs and enable services that mitigate the heat effect.

What else? I like me some google drive on my Macbook.  I use it for a lot of my Macbook workflow in OSX, and it would be nice to implement in Arch. I've tried a couple packages, not them all. But yeah, just things here and there, where its not quite good enough.  And do I want to goto Dropbox where it may be more supported. No not just yet.

I'll find a way.  It'll happen on both these counts. Hey, I got wifi working. That was a whole 2 day ordeal.  Google drive and laptop power management, I'll figure it out.
