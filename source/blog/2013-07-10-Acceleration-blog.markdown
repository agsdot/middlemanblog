Ok folks, what is the definition of acceleration?  A change in velocity, speed plus a vector value.  Not a physics major or studier by any means, but yes things are picking up speed or velocity in the correct direction...forwards.

Things done since yesterday, in my happy coding time (haha, just honestly waiting for someone elses tablet so I can read a pdf file), I'm here working away on my middleman code.

1) Fixed the inline comments for code on the 7/9 post.  Once middleman's great for learning markdown and haml by doing, not by reading and overviewing but by doing.

2) Changed the link path for Jonathan in the upper left hand corner to the site_url which was set in the config.rb .

3) More noticeable, I changed the path from agsdot.github.io/middlemanblog/blog to something far more sane [agsdot.github.io/thoughts/blog](http://agsdot.github.io/thoughts/blog).  A big improvement I say?

Yay or Nay?

P.s. Did I spell Yay/Nay either of them wrong?  Phonetically though they are perfect.
