title: JS Front Eng and DataTables.js 
summary: great js library for presenting tables
tags: javascript, frontend, rails

Did a few small projects today.  At first with [tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/) and then with
rails.  Both of them used the jquery library [datatables.js](https://datatables.net/) .  Its quite
a swell library.

Sidenote, using Tabletop js was quite awesome.  Neat way to create quick
mockups.  Railscast was useful in integrating the datatables jquery gem
with the project.

All in all a productive coding day.
