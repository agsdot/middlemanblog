Once again trying to configure the templates the way I want them. With layouts, and nested index files or post layouts.  Learning all the time.

I see an implementation on [Joey Aghion's](joey.aghion.com) page, but its using an antiquated middleman version.  Also looks like some unnecessary code. Do want to have a nested index inside a layout for the front page to show the next articles or previous articles button.

Thats what I'm trying to hack.
