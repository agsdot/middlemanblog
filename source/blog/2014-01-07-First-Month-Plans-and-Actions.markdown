It's cool to start 2014 on a fresh page.  One contract ended, and another job will soon start.

In the interim time, their are plans for travel, and improvement of code and other job skills.

Man, lol, their has been so much planned and outlined for the New Years and January, its not even funny. One thing though, Taulia truly instilled within me the value of Scrum and Agile vs Waterfall planning.

I'm definitely going to use this to guide my life and workflow from now on forth.  Sprint, run fast, then relax and reflect a small amount, then sprint.

Epics and large plans are made up of componetized small sprints.  Go forth young man!!!!  Conquer the West!
