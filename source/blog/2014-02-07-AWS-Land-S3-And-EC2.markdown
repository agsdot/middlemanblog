Checkmarks for this year: S3 deployed static files, and aliased a domain with Route 53. Setup Nginx on an EC2 instance, and configured the Elastic IP and the domain name and the nginx configs to work together.

Interesting stuff.  Tough/challenging too.  Would like to also figure out how to deploy gitlab and owncloud on ec2.  Don't know if its how I've set things up, security/ports, or a "droppy" internet connection, but the ssh session keeps on freezing for ec2.  Arg...

I'm liking though doing the research.  Even while researching gitlab, and then scaling back to just deploy a git remote, I'm learning more about git server side. 

There's a lot of documentation out there.  Including a lot from digitalocean. Hum...the reviews are good, but honestly, I don't know if I want to spend more money than I have with some free EC2 micro tier instances, and I got a AWS gift card somewhere to use.  Maybe I'll fork over the cash for digitalocean sometime.  It may be simpler to use, but gosh, AWS seems like the industry standard.
