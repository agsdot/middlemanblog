Was able to visit Twitter yesterday, guest of a friend/teacher attendee from GA SF WDI . Interesting talk, but just great to absorb the ambiance of another tech hq.  Cool cafeteria, and seating area.  In some ways, seemed a bit larger than the Google cafeteria and seating area.  So cool to goto 1355 Market once again!  This time 9th floor!
