Heather Arthur from Mozilla came by and talked about Machine Learning. She truly is one sharp person.  CMU, Firefox, talking about JS and Ruby and all these algorithms.  Machine Learning and how it pertains to how computer recognize patterns and iterate over huge data sets, such as…how to recognize an animals face over 1000 pictures.  Is there a picture of a cat there or not.  Using machines to determine this vs arbitrary if statements that humans might invoke.
Check this out: http://harthur.github.io/kittydar/ .  Brilliant project.
Also, it was cool meeting other people at Github.  Other Code for America Alums.  Jessica Lord @jllor twitter hashtag.  Its cool and so super awesome to have Erik @sferik for one of our instructors.  Super smart, but sometimes, its like, he did CfA. Can us normal people that are trying to attain to even some of his skills, can we do it too?  In talking to Jessica, yes, and more yes so!  Hum…it is something to consider.  I’d like to get to hear more from her when she visits GA, and also perhaps hear from some CfA info sessions.  
Also got to hear from Steven Ragnorak again, and meet another person who hosts the Github Passion Projects who used to work at Yammer.
Yah, the people there, Jessica Steve and others all work at Github or are soon to work there (jessica worked at DIY before).  Man, super cool to go to this place.  P.s. Also cool to see the octocats and the super chill atmosphere.

Passion
Projects

GitHub is always looking for opportunities to better support women in technology. We sponsor women-focused meetups and events all over the world. This year, we’re trying something a little closer to home. We’re proud to introduce Passion Projects, a monthly talk series designed to help surface and celebrate the work of incredible women in our industry. We’ve invited some of our personal heroines in engineering, design, community management, and entrepreneurship to share one of their nearest and dearest passion projects with our community.
