Went to a Ruby meetup today.  It was on Resque, background jobs, etc.  A guy from Washington DC spoke.  Afterwards, however networked, heard about other peoples companies and the technology.

At the end talked to John Seidel, super cool guy -- man a lot of the EB Ruby folks remind me of Berkeley FOSS academics. Super chill and easy to talk to.

Anyhow, he mentioned that chef is hot in the devops and ruby space.  Good to know John. I'll be reading them docs and practicing it up with vagrant!
