Ok first things first. In open source, give credit where credit is due.  Well [dbtlr.com](http://www.dbtlr.com), I give you credit.  The source code for your page helped me get a jump start on middleman.  The middleman gem/template/compass all that regular stuff initializer...I really needed helped on seeing the subdirectory of the blog code and also having a front page. Dbtlr.com you helped me with that.

That being said, the code for `blog.articles[0...10].each do` I wonder what'll happen once I hit that threshold of more than 10 posts.  We shall see.  I'll probably need to put in code for a "next" button/hyperlink.

Also other things to discover in the great middleman ruby static blogging beyond: disqus integration, and importing from those other language (php wordpress, tumblr I don't know what you are) database based systems.

Anyhow, simple thoughts for a simple day.
