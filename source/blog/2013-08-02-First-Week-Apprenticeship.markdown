Right now its the Friday apprentice overview/debriefing. It was quite
nice comparing experiences to the other groups.  Hearing stories about
the places they are working at, and how long it took to install their
boxes (lol, django and python for the most part).

I've enjoyed the week.  Groovy is a distinctive enough language to pose
a learning challenge.  Python too is a distinctive language, no
negatives there. But what I mean it is a much less closely related to
ruby (python and ruby syntax and type of language is much closer related).  Groovy will be a nice challenge to learn another language and environment, but also on the side learning the base layer language of Java.  

I'm enjoying working with two other people from WDI. Its fun sharing
experiences, but also pair programming sometimes and comparing ideas on
how to solve a problem.  All three of us get the challenge of learning
grails, and doing a common coding assignment involving groovy and
grails.

Mentorship is quite good at Taulia.  We each have a mentor, and I really
like their engineering department. Its cool getting exposed to the
engineering tools they used.  Learning the software, and getting exposed
to the types of engineering styles (e.g. sprints, scrumm, agile, etc).

Good week all in all.
