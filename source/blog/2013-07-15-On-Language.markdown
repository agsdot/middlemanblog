Ok Folks. Is this a little bit premature?  Perhaps so.  Concession: I definitely want to dig deep into Ruby and Javascript, and that I will continue to do so.

I do notice that many a folks use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) / a la [Python](http://www.python.org/). It's either Rails or Django.  And then there are the minority node based folks, but overal its Django in 2nd place.

I'm kinda wondering how to use [Virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv).  As rvm and rbenv are to ruby, so is Virtualenv.  It seems interesting.  Using pip and global vs folder based python environment and bin installs.

In a few months, 3-6 months, I'm sure this'll make a lot more sense to me.

P.s. Just experimenting with Django tutorial today, and setting this up with Virtualenv.
