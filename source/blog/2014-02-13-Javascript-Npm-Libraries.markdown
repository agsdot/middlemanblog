Wow...woohee....having an interesting time relearning and getting to know node better.  Messing around with Node, npm, and express, connect, require, cheerio and other npm libraries.  Trying to scrape sites with xml and json, json.parse and cheerio to scrape stuff.  Require'ing stuff first and their urls.

Its an entirely different world than ruby.  Its a fun one though.  Get to mess around and relearn different functions.  Definitely need to get this whole thing on scope down.
