summary: Working with Middleman layouts 
tags: Middleman, Haml, templates

Ok folks, you may have noticed that I've finally got the next and previous button working.  Woot, woot, woot!!! I can't say that enough. 

Got the index haml file and the layouts working properly after tinkering long enough.  Of course, knowing/learning the middleman keywords and variables doesn't hurt either (paginate:true, next_page, etc).

Of course, still some stuff more to polish out. Get tags working, add comments.  But yah, the lack of next and previous buttons was bothering me.  Who wants to scroll a page down that long?

Anyhow on another front, still contemplating the whole middleman/ruby and wintersmith/javascript static site paradigm tension.  I want to learn javascript.  It could arguably be said that it is future with nodejs and all, but really whatever job you land at, you gotta deal with it, so why not practice it.  Its just that middleman is so robust, I mean common, templates for not just impressjs, but also phonegap?!?  That's just to amazing!

I dunno, maybe I'll tackle a site with middleman and another with a javascript static site generator (e.g. wintersmith, docpad, etc--the big guns, lol or at least the ones with the most momentum, git commits, most support offered). I do gotta refresh some of my websites on the domains that I have.

Well, I'll keep you posted when and if I do start working on more static sites.  In the meantime, middleman blog, I be happy.

P.s. Oh yah, I gotta figure out how to migrate all them tumblr posts off yahooland and onto these markdown files.  I'll figure it out--gotta be an exporter somewhere.

P.s.s. To those that do not like casual grammar and syntax, I empathize.  It drives me crazy sometimes too.  But for all the "gotta, gonna, dunno" words sprinkled here and there, excuse my degression into such grammar.  I am just so excited that I had a breakthrough in the templates this weekend.
