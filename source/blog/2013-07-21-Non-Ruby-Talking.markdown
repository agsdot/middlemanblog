How about this, a post not queued or tied to programming*.  Sans ruby
[danielsan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/), eh?  

Ok, so in the spare time, whats there to relax and read thats not
programming related. Lots I say lots. 

As ESPN is to sports, so is this [watchlist](http://www.distrowatch.com) to myself.  Keep track of
them stats, and the stuff happening in the Linux world.

Innundated by HackerNews or by Reddit?  Realize it this, edited websites
with editors don't innundate and flood you with "news."  This is [one](http://www.lifehacker.com) of
the better ones.  Thank you Gina Trapani and Adam Pash and Melanie
Pinola.

Want another site with a good international flair, you know when your
tired of the corporate zoot suits of cnet and zdnet?  Try out [OSNews.com](http://www.osnews.com)
.  Editors with flavor from across the globe.  Adam from the US.
Eugenia from Greece, one of the original contributors but now somewhat
of a Senior Statesman (and her husband Jean Baptiste-Queru of Google
Android AOSP fame).  And Thom Holwerda of the Netherlands.  A great
American European spin on tech news.  

Happy Reading,

JL

P.s. I'll follow soon with a post not related (i.e. != ) programming or
being tech related.  But thats for another time.
