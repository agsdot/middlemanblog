Reinitialized middleman from middleman init .

Modus operandi: to build up a middleman application, with static
frontpages and blog section from the grounds up.

Will be using, and comparing items from scaffolded middleman apps, but
will not be directly using the scaffolding created by them.  Will be
using them mainly as a comparison.

Desire is to build off a plain-jane middleman app, and go from there for
future learning, and also plus as a side beneit to build a blog.

P.s. Middleman seems like a great way to test templating languages such
as haml scss compass and slim.  Let the experimentation begin.
